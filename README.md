# E-Commerce-Microservices

• The E-commerce Platform is a scalable and resilient system built using microservices architecture. It
consists of multiple microservices, including Order Service, Product Service, Inventory Service, and
Notification Service.
• These microservices interact with each other to handle various aspects of the e-commerce process, such as
order management, product catalog, inventory tracking, and notifications.
• The project incorporates key features such as an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway, a
Circuit Breaker pattern, and an Event-Driven Architecture powered by Kafka.
